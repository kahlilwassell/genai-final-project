# Agentic Run Coach (Final Project)

This repository will host the final project for the generative AI class: an agentic running coach that combines RAG, LangGraph, and safety guardrails to build personalized training plans.

## Getting started
1. Create and activate a virtual environment (already present at `.venv/` if you want to reuse).
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Add any required API keys to a local `.env` file (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`).

## Project status
Currently just initialized. Code, data ingestion scripts, and Streamlit UI will be added next.
